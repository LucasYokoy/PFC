“This was another highly unusual quarter, and I couldn’t be more proud of and grateful to our employees around the globe,”
said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “As expected, we spent over $4 billion on incremental COVID-19-related costs in
the quarter to help keep employees safe and deliver products to customers in this time of high demand—purchasing personal
protective equipment, increasing cleaning of our facilities, following new safety process paths, adding new backup family care
benefits, and paying a special thank you bonus of over $500 million to front-line employees and delivery partners. We’ve
created over 175,000 new jobs since March and are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular, fulltime
positions. And third-party sales again grew faster this quarter than Amazon’s first-party sales. Lastly, even in this
unpredictable time, we injected significant money into the economy this quarter, investing over $9 billion in capital projects,
including fulfillment, transportation, and AWS.”

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 30, 2020, and are subject to substantial
uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the
Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of
July 30, 2020 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is
highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the
pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the
impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our
significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and
consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are
uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to
concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the third quarter to date, and the
additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the
third quarter, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to
materially affect our operations.
Third Quarter 2020 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $87.0 billion and $93.0 billion, or to grow between 24% and 33% compared with
third quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.0 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in third quarter
2019. This guidance assumes more than $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or
legal settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of
reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial
agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment
throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and
technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects
from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More
information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent
filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

______________________________
(1) On January 1, 2019, we adopted accounting guidance amending the accounting for leases, which did not have a material impact on our 2019 operating results. Prior period
amounts were not retrospectively adjusted. Under this new guidance, leases we previously referred to as “capital leases” are now referred to as “finance leases.” Leases we
previously referred to as “finance leases” are now referred to as “financing obligations.”
(2) For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $11,944
million and $13,110 million.
(3) For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $8,693 million and $10,504
million.
(4) Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.”
(5) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.”
(6) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired
under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is
included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.”
