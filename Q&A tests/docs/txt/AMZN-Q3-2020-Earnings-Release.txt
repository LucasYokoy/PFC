“Two years ago, we increased Amazon’s minimum wage to $15 for all full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees
across the U.S. and challenged other large employers to do the same. Best Buy and Target have stepped up, and we hope other

“Offering jobs with industry-leading pay and great healthcare, including to entry-level and front-line employees, is even more
meaningful in a time like this, and we’re proud to have created over 400,000 jobs this year alone. We’re seeing more customers
than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday
season. Big thank you to our employees and selling partners around the world who’ve been busy getting ready to deliver for
customers this holiday.”

to manage the scale and complexity of time series – such as data collected from industrial equipment, website

volumes for Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). The new io2 volume is designed for 100x higher volume
durability (99.999%) when compared to the 99.9% durability offered by io1 Amazon EBS volumes. Higher volume
durability reduces the likelihood of storage failures and makes the primary copy of customers’ data more resilient,
resulting in better application availability. With io2, customers can drive 10x higher input/output operations per second
(IOPS) from their provisioned storage at the same price as io1, so performance improves significantly without
increasing storage cost.
• AWS announced the general availability of AWS Nitro Enclaves, a new capability that makes it easier for customers
to create isolated compute environments within Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to securely process
and protect highly sensitive data. AWS Nitro Enclaves helps customers reduce the attack surface for their applications
by providing a trusted, highly isolated, and hardened environment for data processing. Each Enclave is a virtual
machine created using the same Nitro Hypervisor technology that provides CPU and memory isolation for Amazon
EC2 instances, but with no persistent storage, no administrator or operator access, and no external networking.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 29, 2020, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of
growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our
estimates as of October 29, 2020 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed
above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and
scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the
pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and
productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in
affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party
sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns,
including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the fourth
quarter to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on
our operations for the fourth quarter, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic
are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations.
Fourth Quarter 2020 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 28% and 38% compared
with fourth quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 90 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $1.0 billion and $4.5 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in fourth quarter
2019. This guidance assumes approximately $4.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or
legal settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of
reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial
agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment
throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and
technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects
from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More
information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent
filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

______________________________
(1) On January 1, 2019, we adopted accounting guidance amending the accounting for leases, which did not have a material impact on our 2019 operating results. Prior period
amounts were not retrospectively adjusted. Under this new guidance, leases we previously referred to as “capital leases” are now referred to as “finance leases.” Leases we
previously referred to as “finance leases” are now referred to as “financing obligations.”
(2) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of
$13,222 million and $13,075 million.
(3) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $8,754 million and
$11,054 million.
(4) Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.”
(5) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.”
(6) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment
acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities,
which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.”
